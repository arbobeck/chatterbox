# chatterbox
Chatterbox is a text-to-speech program written in Python that utilizes gTTS AI voices.
You upload a PDF to the program, it extracts the text, creates an mp3 file, and saves it to the desired location.

Required libraries:
(1) gTTS (AI voices)
(2) PyPDF2 (PDF reader)

*NOTE* gTTS has limited capacity, therefore making this program impractical if you need large or multiple files to be processed.
